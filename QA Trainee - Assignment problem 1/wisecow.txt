I apologize as I am not familiar with Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD,TLS setup.
However, I am confident that after securing a job, I will develop my skills in
all of these areas. I have experience in Python programming, Selenium, GitHub,
and I have solved problem 2. I am eager to expand my knowledge and
grow my expertise in these technologies to contribute effectively to future projects.
